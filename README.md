* Scienpatic AI offers a powerful AI-powered credit decisioning platform that uses proprietary Machine Learning and AI algorithms that allow institutions to monitor for fraud, assess credit, and provide a better and quicker experience for customers.

* Scienaptic AI currently uses large e Machine Learning, AI, and large-scale data analytics on its current platform "Ether" to provide this advanced decision-making.

## Landscape

* Scienaptic is currently in the fintech industry and credit underwriting space.

* The key trends in this field over the last 5 - 10 years are the increasing use and implementation of AI and Machine Learning with large data sets and digital lending platforms that help expand financial inclusion.

* The other major companies in this field include Zest AI, SmartBiz Loans, Kui Global, Trust Science, Laso, and Lokyata.

## Results

* The company has very similar results to companies using similar technologies to perform the same tasks the difference is Scienaptic AI's ability to help lenders of all sizes from $100 million in assets to $10 billion in assets

## Recommendations

* I would suggest that Scienaptic AI consider offering and additional services that could further enhance the credit decision process for their financial institution customers such as developing predictive analysis tools that help lenders identify potential credit risks and judge borrowers more accurately.

* Predictive analysis tools can help lenders identify high-risk borrowers minimize defaults and losses, and detect emerging credit trends and opportunities to expand their lending portfolios.
   

* A predictive analytics tool would leverage predictive modeling algorithms to forecast credit risk and performance, Natural language processing to extract insights from alternative data sources, and optimization algorithms to recommend policy and underwriting adjustments.

* The integration of predictive analytics into Scienaptic AI's capabilities enhances credit risk management, enabling lenders to make data-driven decisions. This strengthens its mission to boost credit access and profitability.
